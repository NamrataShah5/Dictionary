# Dictionary
This project focuses on LinkedList data structure

I built this project so I could understand what collection of states the linked list data structure contains and what operations can be performed. Additionally, each node contains a key and pair value, resembling a hash table. I learned how to build this ADT with restrictions.

What each file does:

Dictionary: Constructs a linked list with nodes of key and pair value. A specific can be looked for in the list, new node can be inserted to end of list, and node can be deleted.

DictionaryClient: Thoroughly tests the operations and constructors of the Dictionary ADT

DictionaryInterface: States the methods to be defined in Dictionary

KeyNotFoundException: If key is not in linked list, throw an exception

DuplicateKeyException: If the key exists already, throw an exception
